Points-to analysis

Constraints:

ANYTHING = &ANYTHING
ESCAPED = *ESCAPED
ESCAPED = ESCAPED + UNKNOWN
*ESCAPED = NONLOCAL
NONLOCAL = &NONLOCAL
NONLOCAL = &ESCAPED
INTEGER = &ANYTHING
ESCAPED = &NULL

Collapsing static cycles and doing variable substitution
Building predecessor graph
Detecting pointer and location equivalences


// The constraint graph before var-substitution in dot format:
strict digraph {
  node [
    shape = box
  ]
  edge [
    fontsize = "12"
  ]

  // List of nodes and complex constraints in the constraint graph:
"NULL";
"ANYTHING"[label="ANYTHING = { 2 }"];
"STRING";
"ESCAPED"[label="ESCAPED = { 1 }"];
"NONLOCAL"[label="NONLOCAL = { 4 5 }"];
"STOREDANYTHING";
"INTEGER"[label="INTEGER = { 2 }"];
"*NULL";
"*ANYTHING";
"*STRING";
"*ESCAPED";
"*NONLOCAL";
"*STOREDANYTHING";
"*INTEGER";

  // Edges in the constraint graph:
"*ESCAPED" -> "ESCAPED";
"NONLOCAL" -> "*ESCAPED";
}


Rewriting constraints and unifying variables
Uniting pointer but not location equivalent variables
Finding indirect cycles


// The constraint graph before solve-graph in dot format:
strict digraph {
  node [
    shape = box
  ]
  edge [
    fontsize = "12"
  ]

  // List of nodes and complex constraints in the constraint graph:
"NULL";
"ANYTHING";
"STRING";
"ESCAPED" [label="\N\nESCAPED = ESCAPED + UNKNOWN\lESCAPED = *ESCAPED\l*ESCAPED = NONLOCAL\l"];
"NONLOCAL";
"STOREDANYTHING";
"INTEGER";

  // Edges in the constraint graph:
"STOREDANYTHING" -> "ESCAPED";
}


Solving graph


// The constraint graph after solve-graph in dot format:
strict digraph {
  node [
    shape = box
  ]
  edge [
    fontsize = "12"
  ]

  // List of nodes and complex constraints in the constraint graph:
"NULL";
"ANYTHING";
"STRING";
"ESCAPED" [label="\N\nESCAPED = ESCAPED + UNKNOWN\lESCAPED = *ESCAPED\l*ESCAPED = NONLOCAL\l"];
"NONLOCAL";
"STOREDANYTHING";
"INTEGER";

  // Edges in the constraint graph:
"STOREDANYTHING" -> "ESCAPED";
}



Points-to sets

ANYTHING = { ANYTHING }
ESCAPED = { NULL }
NONLOCAL = { ESCAPED NONLOCAL }
STOREDANYTHING = { }
INTEGER = { ANYTHING }


Alias information for main

Aliased symbols


Call clobber information

ESCAPED, points-to NULL, points-to vars: { }

Flow-insensitive points-to information


main ()
{
  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  return 0;

}
